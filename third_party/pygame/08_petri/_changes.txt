* blob.py
* engine.py
* food.py

---+ Add some utility functions and the update class.
     Food can now provide nutrition.
     Blobs can die.
     The poor blobs can't go anywhere and eat yet (we'll fix that
     next).

As a note, both petri.py and engine.py are now done. They have done
their jobs and we can do the rest of the work on the gameobject, blobs,
and food.
