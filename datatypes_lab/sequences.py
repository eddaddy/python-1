# Call list() on a string.
# How does the list constructor work?



# Call list() on a dict. 
# What is the output and why?



# Convert this list to a tuple.
l3 = [1, 2, 3]

# Compare the list [1, 2, 3] with the tuple (1, 2, 3).
# Why are they not equal?



# Compare the following two lists (different addresses in memory).
# Why are they equal?
l4 = [1, 2, 3]
l5 = [1, 2, 3]
print l4 == l5
