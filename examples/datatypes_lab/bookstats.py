----

Use data/TaleOfTwoCities.txt.



Start:

* Count the number words in the book by calling split.
* Figure out the top ten most used words using a dictionary and sorted.



Experiment 1:

* Use a regular expression instead of calling split. Simple or complex is fine.



Experiment 2:

* use filter to get rid of words that contain numbers.
* use map to make all the words the same case.



Experiment 3:

* Use the collections.Counter to replace the work done with the dictionary and sorted.
