Requirements

* [pygame](http://pygame.org)

To run, open the final folder and:

    python petri.py

Left click to drop blobs. Right click to drop food to feed your blobs.

I put this code together in separate folders representing distinct steps. Folders are essentially diffs. The `_changes.txt` files contain notes about each step and files to look at for each.

The images are mine, and the music I got from:

    song: Voyager
