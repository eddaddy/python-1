# WTF Planets?

I've often pointed people new to Python or just new to programming to [Al Sweigart's](http://coffeeghost.net/about/) book [Invent with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/). I think working on games is a fun way to learn a new programming language (for myself included), and a good way to get past those early frustrations while one is working out the nuances. I've pointed people to the [Dodger](http://inventwithpython.com/chapter20.html) example often and with good results.

One response I often get is, "Yeah, but I don't work on video games." Fair enough. Having gotten this response enough, and since I'm heading to a Python meetup this week, I sat down today and ended up rewriting Dodger for a discussion on [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news.html). I wanted an example of code that was closer to standard [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), had more object orientedness, and had a (very simple) stage layout, as well as a more ubiquitous entity interface, and was a step closer to the [Battling Seizure Robots](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Battling_Seizure_Robots). I've always liked the original Dodger because I think it's easy for people new to Python to grok (as I believe that's the intention behind the code), but I also wanted something that was more hipster-ish, jargon-friendly, and was Soviet Russia friendly (where video games work on you).
